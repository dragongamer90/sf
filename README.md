StrikeForce
===========

A 2D Top Down Multiplayer Tactical Team Shooter Game

Idea
----

* Inspired by Frozen Synaps
* The game tries to trigger an emotional response in the player in a number of ways
  * By having the death of your team mates effect the gameplay by manipulating both the graphics and audio
  * By having game modes where there is an option other than extermination of the enemy team members to achieve victory

I am trying to create an environment different to that of Call of Duty and Battlefield 3.
In thease games players run around chaotically and work by themselves to increase their stats. This game
will focus on encouraging team cooperation by introducing aspects such as permadeath and physical game play
being effected by team member deaths.
